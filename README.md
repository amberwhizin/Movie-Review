# TellyCritic 

An app where you can record and organize your movie/television show thoughts and feelings. Did you ever watch a movie and have SO many opinions but you couldn’t share them with your movie/television show partner? I do! Rotten Tomatoes too much for you? Me too! Well, fear not, now you can have your own app to store those thoughts in your own full-stack Movie-Review application! Just click to add a movie, then add the title of the film and your personal rating. Don’t forget to grab an image you like and paste that in too! Click submit and add your review. You can add, edit and delete, you can do it all!
